# restaurant

- Independently designed a mock website for a restaurant in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Focused on using JavaScript to dynamically draw each page of the website rather than hyperlinking separate pages
- Completed using WebPack with a focus on how to manipulate the DOM while maintaining page loading speeds
- Used basic colour theory and hand drawn designs to create an aesthetically pleasing product
